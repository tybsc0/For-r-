1. 1. Accept a number from user and print its multiplication table using For loop. 
>>>>>>>
n=int(input("Enter A Number"))
for y in range(1,11):
    z=n*y
    print(n,"X",y,"=",z)

2.Accept a number from user and print its factorial using While loop. 
>>>>>>>>
x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
y = 1
f = 1

while y <= x:
    f *= y
    y += 1
print("Factorial of", x, "=", f)

3.Accept a number from user. Pass this number to a function which will test if the number is a multiple of 7 and is divisible by 5.
>>>>>>>>
X=int(input("Enter a number"))
def test(a):
     if(a%7==0):
        if(a%5==0):
            print(" number is a multiple of 7 and is divisible by 5")
        else:
             print(" number is a multiple of 7 but not divisible by 5")
     elif(a%5==0):
           print("Number is divisible by 5 but not a multiple of 7")
     else:
        print("Number is neither a multiple of 7 nor divisible by 5")

4. Accept a number from user(n). Print the numbers from n to 1 in reverse order by using a recursive function.
>>>>>>
n=int(input("ENter a number"))
def display(x):
    print(x)
    if(x>1):
        display(x-1)
    else:
        return
display(n)

5.Create a List L with 5 numbers stored in it. Write a loop program which calculates and prints the sum of all the numbers stored in the List.
>>>>>>>>>
L = [7, 8, 92, 56, 22]
sum = 0  

for i in L:
    sum += i  

print("Sum of all numbers in L:", sum)  

6. Write a program to check if the number given by user exists in a tuple. If it is found then print "Yes, No. Found" else print "No. Not found". 
>>>>>>
T=(12,32,89,68,44)
x=int(input("Enter value to be Searched"))
for y in T:
    if(x==y):
        print("yes, No Found")
        break
else:
    print("NO , NOt Found")

7.Given a dictionary get all values from the dictionary and add it in a list but don't add duplicates.
>>>>>>>>>
sDict1={'North':12,'South':39,'East':52,'West':68,'NorthEast':72,'NorthWest':87}
newList=list()
for i in sDict1.values():
    if i not in newList:
        newList.append(i)
print("Unique List:",newList)
